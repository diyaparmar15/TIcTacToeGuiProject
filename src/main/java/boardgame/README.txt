GUI allowing us to play 2 different games 1. TicTacToe 2.NumericalTicTacToe

## Description

This project is an OOP project in java where we were supposed to design a GUI allowing the user to play 2 games on the computer
in more of a visual way rather than just on the console.


## Getting Started

### Executing program

(Similar to running the exampleguiproject)

1. "gradle build" -> in the scioer shell terminal 
2. "java -jar build/libs/A3.jar" -> In another normal terminal

Expected output:

There are no save/load functionalities included in the assignment
